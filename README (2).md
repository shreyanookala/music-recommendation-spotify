## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Spotify Developer Account (to get your own Client ID and Client Secret)
- Spotipy Library (`pip install spotipy`)

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter or any compatible environment.
3. Replace the `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` in the notebook with your own.
4. Run the cells to obtain song recommendations.

## Example Usage

```python
input_song_name = "I'm Good (Blue)"
recommendations = hybrid_recommendations(input_song_name, num_recommendations=5)
print(recommendations)
```

## Dependencies

- requests
